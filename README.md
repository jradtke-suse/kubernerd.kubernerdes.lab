kubernerd is a physical NUC with a keyboard, mouse, monitor that will be used to essentially bootstrap my lab in the different iterations.

It will have the following:

* Kubernerdes = SLES + KVM Host on the baremetal (USB Install)
* Atlas = PXE Server (dhcp, tftp, www, etc...) (VM)
* Hyperion = BIND (VM)
